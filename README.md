### Automated Build Tests

I used [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) to test my builds prior to deployments.

1. I set up Travis towards the top of the README.md to show that my builds are still passing through each git push.
2. I set up Travis in a custom .travis.yml which will install all the python requirements and will test through my applications in each git push.

All of my Travis tests are passing as seen in this README.md

### Bugs & Fixes

1. My environmental variables could not be called during live previews/deployments.
    - I started my fix of this bug by spending time looking through my code, and adjusting the variable keywords.
    - I then examined my code in settings.py, of which I could not find any import of the environmental variables.
    - I added 'import env' into the code and pushed my code to github.
    - Once it worked, I setup my S3 AWS and Heroku before collecting static via 'python3 manage.py collectstatic'.
    - After the static files were sent to S3 AWS, I commented out my 'import env' before publishing my site.

## Deployment

- I started my deployment process through gitpods previews, I would preview my code every git push to ensure that it was all running smoothly.

- I started to then run my application using 'python3 manage.py runserver $IP:$PORT' this ran my application and allowed me to view my site in a browser tab.

- I made the application public to allow my friends and family to test my website whilst I had it running.

- I set up a heroku application and set all of my environmental variables into the config variables on heroku.

- I connected my heroku application to my github repository, allowing me to enable automatic deployments through each git push.

- I started hosting my website on heroku after ensuring all my databases were setup correctly.

- Once I could view my live site on heroku, my deployment process was finished, I now force a deployment through heroku, or I push to github and wait for it to run its course.
